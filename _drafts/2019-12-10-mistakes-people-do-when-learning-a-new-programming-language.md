### Trying to learn everything in a single day

Most beginners I meet are very interested or in a hurry of a job search, this can be a motivating factor in the beginning but if you don't have enough patience, it'll undermine your efforts to reach expertise. The human brain can only learn so much within a given time frame, so there is no point in trying to dump your brain with a lot of information.

Have a schedule or a time where you limit yourself to learn only so much and then spend time in other less brain-intensive activities, I found solutions to some of my complex coding problems when I am away from my computer and I also saw few other people said about similar experiences. So its worth stepping away for a while and have some reflection on what you have learned so far.

Everyone is different and have a different method of learning things, some prefer videos, some prefer reading and some prefer to learn by reverse-engineering something. Find out which is your way and stick to that way of learning.

You should know that if your current learning method is working well for you or not and change the method if you have to. To find out which learning method works for you, [take this test](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml) and use it as a starting point.
