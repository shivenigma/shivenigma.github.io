# A college degree is mandatory to get a job in tech?

Recently, I've seen people discuss in Twitter about whether a college degree is required to get into a tech job or if having one gives you any competitive advantage over the self-taught ones. I believe I can add a cent or two to that discussion.

I am a self-taught developer working for around 7 years now. I don't have a computer science degree or not even a bachelor's degree for that matter. In short, a college degree is not mandatory to get a job in the tech industry but having one will be helpful in various situations.

> I am from India so my experience related to jobs and hiring is only applicable to the Indian job market. But my experience of working as a software developer is universal and can be applicable to you.

The good parts

1. You won't have a student loan and don't have to run every day to repay it. It can be daunting from my personal experience and from some people I know.
2. You don't have to spend X years of your life studying for exams and those years might actually be a head start for your career.
3. The college degrees are becoming less and less relevant to the actual things you have to do on the job. So it is not assured that you'll land a job offer after finishing your degree or you'll be employable.

The bad parts,

1. Companies may not hire you for not having a degree. In India, a lot of companies won't consider candidates without a college degree regardless of their skills or experience. This will limit your choice to startups and mid-sized companies.
2. You might sometimes find it hard to understand the concepts related to computer science. It is not impossible to learn them on your own. You need to be self-aware of your gaps and constantly work on improving them.
3. In my personal experience, people tried to take advantage of me in negotiations. Since getting a job without a degree is pretty rare in India, they thought that I didn't have any other choices.

Final thoughts

Those saying a computer science degree is required to be a software engineer are likely to be gate-keepers. A degree has very less effect on how great a developer can be. In general, Computer science and Software Engineering are two different things.

It is not very easy to get your first job without a CS degree. I had to take an internship without a salary for a few months and then I was paid a little stipend, only to be fired after 6 months. But It wasn't hard getting another opportunity with that little experience.

Once you got your first job and gained some considerable experience, not having a degree will become less relevant. If you can spend the time and money on education and get a degree, go for it. Things will be much easier if you have one. But If you are not in a position to do it, consider putting some hard work in building your portfolio, and start applying for jobs.

Don't assume you'll have to know everything on the job description to be able to apply for the job. Companies will always be ready to negotiate on technical skills because it is easier to train people technically. When I applied for the internship I know next to nothing about coding, and I was selected.

I mean no disrespect to the universities or their curriculum, but after all these years we should really start questioning the relevance of teaching COBOL in universities. This post is mostly from my personal experiences and I would love to hear your thoughts about it.
