I committed to converting myself into a [Dvorak typist in 2020](https://vignesh.pro/qwerty-to-dvorak/). After trying a gradual switch for 3 months, I went cold turkey this July. It was a painful and equally enjoyable experience. Writing code is major part of my job, so I can't use the standard Dvorak. The symbols are not easy to type the in standard for me. I went with the [programmer's Dvorak](https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/). Hereafter I will mention it as just Dvorak.

The obvious choice would be to buy a custom programmable keyboard. But they are really expensive and I don't easily act on the impulse to buy anything ([Learned it from Gandhi](https://viewthroughmywindow.com/the-minimalist-gandhi/)). I would like to test how far I can actually go without getting one of those. So in the attempt, I rearranged the keys on my [amazon basics keyboard](https://amzn.to/3jGzD02) to match the programmer's dvorak Layout. For touch typing you don't really need to do this, changing the OS level settings should do it. But this was one of the reason my gradual switch failed and I keep going back to qwerty. I wanted the correct key in place to help when I need a reference.

To my bad luck, the F and J Keycaps were a different designs than the rest of the keys. So I had to leave those untouched in their qwerty place. As a result, H and U key caps were also ended up in different positions in my setup. Programmer's dvorak reorders the numbers keys differently. The symbols takes the numbers place and the numbers are typed using shift. The symbol + number key association is also changed from qwerty. I reordered my number keys based on the cursed row (As normal Dvorak typers call the numbers in programmer's dvorak). That change made typing symbols impossible with the altered keyboard. The symbols were all messed up in different places and I ended up with something like this.

In the attempt of changing the keycaps, I broke a few keys such as the `{` key. It was one of the most used keys for programmers. I managed to type without that for 2 weeks. I just copy/pasted that symbol wherever I wanted it. I thought I permanently damaged the keyboard and should by a new one. As a last resort, I opened it and saw that the membrane was not placed well. I placed it in the right position and then all keys started working. It was a great relief, I am pretty sure that breaking and fixing things by yourself can be as satisfying as the sound of a mech.

I fixed one part of the issue but still had the 4 keys off and the symbols are in wrong place. It was annoying because I kept going for the wrong keys whenever looked at the keyboard. I decided to create a better reference than the keyboard. I printed and pasted the [layout](https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/) on an amazon delivery box and put in on my desk. It is not pretty but it got the job done. All problems solved, I changed my keyboard layout on Ubuntu and started using it full time.

### Week 1

The first week can be the hardest period of retraining your muscle memory. I felt a little bit of pain and weirdness on my wrists in the new layout. When typing I was like a snail and made a lot of typos. Keys that changed to a nearby position are the big issue. For example, the letter S is changed to the right hand from the left hand, there is a little chance that I would go for the old S. But for letters like H, it was really hard.

I noticed that if you made one typo following your qwerty muscle memory, your hands will follow for a few more letters. I sent gibberish to people in slack frequently because I used to hit enter fast. I came really close to switiching to qwerty just to reply to a message or just for a small thing. Switching back to the old layout does more harm than good. You're breaking your muscle memory for qwerty in the first few weeks. Going back to it is counter-intuitive.

Out of all the issues I faced after the switch, shortcuts are the real problem. I am a keyboard user and used to not touching the mouse for a lot of things. This switch made me use mouse all the time because shortcuts remapping is really hard. There are multiple issues that I faced with shortcuts, I'll discuss them later in the post.

### Week 2

I felt like it was getting worse everyday, I often went to qwerty layout unconsciously. I had to remember that I'm typing in a Dvorak. Closing eyes and visualizing the Dvorak layout was helpful but it slowed me down. My speed was around 20 WPM but accuracy has gone to shit. One thing I learned in my typewriting course 13 years ago is, accuracy and correct finger position is important than typing faster. It is hard to break the bad finger positions once you've formed the muscle memory with them.

After a few days into week 2, I felt less friction from qwerty's muscle memory. I really missed being able to type faster without the typos and without having to think about it constantly. Over the weekend I finished an entire [blog post](https://errorsshouldneverpasssilently.com/5-mistakes-i-made-as-a-beginner-with-angular-js/) using dvorak. It was also my first guest blog post in a site other than my work blogs. I do really have less pain when typing when compared with qwerty. Fingers are moving much better in their natural movement rather than doing some tricky positions.

Over the end of the second week Dvorak started to feel natural. I still make mistakes but now I realize quickly that I made a typo. I particularly have trouble with the upper rows and the numbers/symbols. I realized how numbers are arranged in Programmer's dvorak today. 9 and 0 starts in the middle and to the left you can find the odd numbers and to the right you got even numbers. So the numbers are mapped odd and even for left and right hand respectively. This might be an obvious thing for you, not for me. Now I don't get why people say this is a cursed row, it makes much sense than the numerical order to me and typing numbers is easier.

### Day that I lost track

After the second week I stopped tracking the Dvorak progress. Somewhere in the third week, I had to use qwerty. It felt really stranger now. My muscle memory has been broken and Dvorak memory is being built. I know that some people are really comfortable with both qwerty and Dvorak. My curret goal is to master Dvorak and I am not really worried about qwerty at all.

## Metrics

If you're reading this far, you are likely to test the waters. So let me share my metrics before and after the switch.

[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/7df6beec767a4888902c13c5e47850a2)

I tested myself using [https://play.typeracer.com](https://play.typeracer.com/), the metrics might seem counter-intuitive to you. After all, everyone switched to dvorak has done that for getting faster. But my goal is to reduce the finger and wrist movement and in-turn reduce the risk of RSI. I believe it is working for my goals. I was able to manage to work for 3 weeks without anyone noticing any slowness for 3 weeks. It turns out that you don't really need to be that faster unless you're getting paid for the number of pages you can type.

I do believe that given enough time I can go faster or atleast attain my qwerty speed. The people in /r/dvorak are claiming to have earned better speed than their qwerty. It will take months to be able to get back to that speed. Let's see.

### Shortcuts

If you ask me what's the most painful thing in switching to a new layout, my answer is shortcuts. I have configured a lot of shortcuts based on qwerty. After the change, it became really hard to use them. Even the universal shortcuts such as Cut/Copy/Paste won't be in the same place. **If you're considering switching, know what you're signing up for.** I am a Vim user and configured a lot of shortcuts based on Vim's key layout. Now they are also broken, so my entire workflow has been broken down. This is the important issue than the reduced typing speed. There are various ways to fix that such as some scripts/apps that switches the layout to qwerty when you press modifier keys such as CTRL and ALT. This can be a temporary solution but I don't like it because I still have to remember the qwerty position of that shortcut key, so I would advise going through the change and relearn your shortcuts. This decision has freed me completly from any dependency on qwerty.

### Weird issues with some Java based applications

I set up the Dvorak layout as the second input method in my machine. I use Webstorm as my primary IDE. When I try to use a shortcut in webstorm by pressing any modifier key, the system's input method will switch to the qwerty. For some, this may be a feature because they can continue using their old shortcuts. But it was really frusturating for me as I wanted to get rid of qwerty from everywhere.

I begun searching for a solution for this and found out that this is a bug in JDK for some years now, there were lot of solutions posted on stackoverflow questions but none worked. After a week, I found this [simple solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40152268/3098872). If you set multiple input sources in your system, some JDK applications tend to pick the first soure you set as the default input method for shortcuts. The solution is to remove any additional inupt methods or to move the Dvorak layout as the first input source. With this I solved all the issues I had with Dvorak.

### Games

If you're a gamer, there might be issues for you in gaming with the new layout. The best idea is to continue using qwerty when gaming. I'm an occasional gamer, so this is not a high priority to me. But your milage may vary. If you're considering switching spend some time researching the issues that you might face and see if it worth the trouble.

### Custom apps / scripts for shortcuts

This shortcut problem is not something new, everyone converting to Dvorak must face all these issues and work their waf thorough. There are a handful of apps available to handle this shortcut issue and gives you a seemless experience. But I didn't want to add another layer of abstraction in my workflow, the more layers it has, the more failure points it has. You don't want to spend good part of your day figuring out why some shortcut app is not working well with some other app. I wanted to use the bare bones setup and setup my muscle memory based on that.

The point is once you started customizing the most common defaults such as qwerty, there will be issues and you should be ready to fix them or work around them.

To sum it up, despite of all the issues I faced, I still feel that Dvorak has improved my experience of working with computers. Whether you're looking for improving your typing speed or looking for ways to reduce RSI risk, dvorak will defenitely help you. Will there be any additonal trouble? Likely, there will be. Will it be difficult to use or collaborate with other's systems? Yes. Will I consider going back to qwerty in the future? HELL NO.
